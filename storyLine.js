Suddenly, a throbbing pain on my left arm brought me back to reality. Looking at it, I saw a spider bite with a red mark around it. My eyes caught the movement of a black spider with a red hourglass mark on its back scuttling away into the undergrowth. Panic set in as I realized I had no idea how I got there or how long I had been unconscious. With only a Swiss army knife, a torch and no clue of my whereabouts, fear overtook me. How was I going to survive?",

The vibrant green leaves seemed to form a natural barrier between me and what lay beyond the waterfall. Despite leaves obstructing the view of the waterfall, there was an opportunity to climb up nearby branches and peer beyond the waterfall. The branches would act as a natural ladder, granting access to the higher vantage point. However, they did look slippery from the mist of the waterfall.",
