Suddenly, a throbbing pain on my left arm brought me back to reality. Looking at it, I saw a spider bite with a red mark around it. My eyes caught the movement of a black spider with a red hourglass mark on its back scuttling away into the undergrowth. Panic set in as I realized I had no idea how I got there or how long I had been unconscious. With only a Swiss army knife, a torch and no clue of my whereabouts, fear overtook me. How was I going to survive?",

Despite leaves obstructing the view of the waterfall, there was an opportunity to climb up nearby branches and peer beyond the waterfall. The branches would act as a natural ladder, granting access to the higher vantage point. However, they did look slippery from the mist of the waterfall.",
